Space Hop - by James Ruggieri (Lesson 3 - Udacity FEND Program)

To Start Game: Merely load index.html into any modern browser (Preferably the latest version of Chrome, Safari or Firefox)

To Play Game: You control "Spacenaut". Spacenaut couldn't dock on the space station because the space ship was running an out-dated OS. Thus he could only get close. You need to help Spacenaut get from the spaceship "deck" (great views I hear) across the "gap" of space to the space station deck (equally good views, but more comfy, better food and cool aliens to hang out with). 

Beware though as local aliens have seen your ship and know you're not docked, so they are swarming in. Avoid the aliens at all costs or you'll pay w/ your life! (Well, on of them anyways...). You get 3 lives to start.

Keep an eye out for the Green Gems which appear durring alien swarms. Pick them up on the way across for bonus points (also, cool aliens on the space station love them as souveniers! Hand 'em out for a fun happy hour on the deck!)

Spacenaut's space suit comes w/ an anti-gravity control "booster" that works in pulses. Use the Arrow keys to control the pulses and get across the gap to the space station.

CONTROLS:
- Up Arrow - Move one tile up
- Down Arrow - Move one tile down
- Left Arrow - Move one arrow left
- Right Arrow - Move one arrow right

ENEMIES:
Any collision with an enemy alien will cost you 1 of your lives AND 50 points.

Gems appear at random for random periods of time. Collect a gem by running into it. Each Gem earns you 100 points.

High Score:
Earn the high score and be the envy of all your friends... and space station residents
